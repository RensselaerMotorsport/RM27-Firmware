// Update dynamic TC value based on slip of wheels
// Compare rear wheel speed to front wheel speed -> determine slip rate
// Based on slip rate (need to determine based on inner wheel in turn?)
Slip Ratio = (Vehicle.Speed.Rear Avg / Vehicle.Speed.Front Avg);

// Dynamic Translation Table gives fraction of theoretical max torque at pedal position
// based on the amount of slip occuring
Dynamic Torque = Dynamic Translation * TC Tune; // To be changed
